    <h4>OBJECTIVE</h4>
    <p>
        To build the server­side component of a “movies” web application. The web application will
        provide users with access to information about different movies, directors, and genres. Users
        will be able to sign up, update their personal information, and create a list of their favorite
        movies.
    </p>
